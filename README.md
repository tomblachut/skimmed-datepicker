# Skimmed Datepicker

Datepicker without bloat. Work in progress, but already pretty fancy.

Please visit https://tomblachut.github.io/skimmed-datepicker/ for a simple demo.

## Features
* Picks dates
* Blazing fast
* Tap, pan & swipe enabled
* Minimal styles

## TODO
* Limit min & max date
* Customizable date formatting
* Popover mode
* Zoom out to year & decade views
* Theming
* Keyboard support

Project structure probably needs some tweaking, IDK, I've never done Open Source Component before.
